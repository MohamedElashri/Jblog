Supersymmetry is a proposed extension to the Standard Model of particle physics that predicts the existence of new particles called “superpartners” for each known particle. These particles would be related to the known particles by a symmetry called “supersymmetry,” which is a hypothetical symmetry between fermions (particles that make up matter) and bosons (particles that transmit forces).</p> <p>The search for supersymmetry at the LHC is motivated by the fact that it could help explain some of the unsolved mysteries in particle physics, such as the nature of dark matter and the hierarchy problem. Dark matter is a type of matter that is thought to make up most of the matter in the universe, but it cannot be observed directly because it does not interact with light. The hierarchy problem refers to the fact that the Standard Model cannot explain the extremely large differences in mass between certain particles, such as the Higgs boson and the top quark.</p> <h2 id="lhc">LHC</h2> <p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world’s most powerful particle accelerator. It is located at the CERN laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, and it is used by physicists to study the fundamental nature of the universe.</p> <p>The LHC consists of a 27-kilometer (17-mile) ring of superconducting magnets that are used to accelerate particles to nearly the speed of light. These particles are then collided at very high energies, creating conditions that are similar to those that existed in the universe shortly after the Big Bang. By studying the debris from these collisions, physicists can learn more about the fundamental particles and forces that make up the universe.</p> <p>The LHC has made several important discoveries since it began operation in 2010. In 2012, it confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson, a particle that is responsible for giving other particles mass. This discovery was a major breakthrough in particle physics and confirmed a key prediction of the Standard Model, the current theory of particle physics.</p> <p>In addition to the Higgs boson, the LHC has also been used to search for evidence of new particles and forces that are predicted by theories beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry (SUSY) and dark matter. So far, these searches have not yet yielded any definitive results, but they continue to be an important part of the LHC’s research program.</p> <p>The LHC is currently undergoing a major upgrade, known as the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), which will increase its collision energy and allow it to collect more data than ever before. This upgrade is expected to be completed in the mid-2020s and will help physicists continue their search for new physics at the frontiers of knowledge.</p> <p>Overall, the LHC is an important tool for advancing our understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe. Its discoveries have already had a major impact on particle physics, and it continues to be at the forefront of scientific research.</p> <h2 id="susy-search">SUSY Search</h2> <p>The LHC is a powerful tool for searching for evidence of supersymmetry because it allows physicists to collide particles at very high energies, creating conditions that are similar to those that existed in the universe shortly after the Big Bang. By studying the debris from these collisions, physicists can look for signs of new particles that would be predicted by supersymmetry.</p> <p>One way to search for evidence of supersymmetry at the LHC is to look for the production of “squarks” and “gluinos,” which are the superpartners of the quarks and gluons that make up protons and neutrons. These particles would be produced in pairs in high-energy collisions, and they would then decay into other particles, such as jets of quarks and leptons (particles that do not interact via the strong nuclear force). By looking for these decay products, physicists can search for evidence of squarks and gluinos.</p> <h3 id="squarks">Squarks</h3> <p>Squarks are hypothetical particles that are predicted by the theory of supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle physics. In the context of SUSY, squarks are the superpartners of quarks, which are the fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. Just as quarks have various “flavors” (up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom), squarks also have corresponding flavors (sup, sdown, scharm, sstrange, stop, and sbottom).</p> <p>The existence of squarks is predicted by SUSY because it is a symmetry between fermions (particles that make up matter) and bosons (particles that transmit forces). In SUSY, each known fermion has a corresponding boson superpartner, and each known boson has a corresponding fermion superpartner. Therefore, if quarks are fermions, then squarks must be their boson superpartners.</p> <p>Squarks are interesting to physicists because they could potentially help explain some of the unsolved mysteries in particle physics, such as the nature of dark matter and the hierarchy problem. Dark matter is a type of matter that is thought to make up most of the matter in the universe, but it cannot be observed directly because it does not interact with light. The hierarchy problem refers to the fact that the Standard Model of particle physics cannot explain the extremely large differences in mass between certain particles, such as the Higgs boson and the top quark.</p> <p>The search for squarks is one of the main goals of experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is the most powerful particle accelerator in the world. At the LHC, physicists collide particles at very high energies in order to create conditions that are similar to those that existed in the universe shortly after the Big Bang. By studying the debris from these collisions, physicists can look for evidence of new particles, such as squarks.</p> <p>If squarks are discovered, it would be a major breakthrough in particle physics and could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe. It could also help confirm the existence of SUSY and provide new insights into the nature of dark matter and the hierarchy problem. However, it is also possible that the LHC will not find evidence of squarks, in which case it would place strong constraints on the viability of SUSY as a theory.</p> <h3 id="gluinos">gluinos</h3> <p>Gluinos are also a hypothetical particles that are predicted by the theory of supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle physics. In the context of SUSY, gluinos are the superpartners of gluons, which are the particles that mediate the strong nuclear force that holds the nucleus of an atom together.</p> <p>The existence of gluinos is predicted by SUSY because it is a symmetry between fermions (particles that make up matter) and bosons (particles that transmit forces). In SUSY, each known fermion has a corresponding boson superpartner, and each known boson has a corresponding fermion superpartner. Therefore, if gluons are bosons, then gluinos must be their fermion superpartners.</p> <p>Gluinos are also interesting to physicists because they could potentially help explain some of the unsolved mysteries in particle physics, such as the nature of dark matter and the hierarchy problem. Dark matter is a type of matter that is thought to make up most of the matter in the universe, but it cannot be observed directly because it does not interact with light. The hierarchy problem refers to the fact that the Standard Model of particle physics cannot explain the extremely large differences in mass between certain particles, such as the Higgs boson and the top quark.</p> <p>If gluinos are discovered, this also would be a major breakthrough in particle physics and could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe. It could also help confirm the existence of SUSY and provide new insights into the nature of dark matter and the hierarchy problem. However, it is also possible that the LHC will not find evidence of gluinos, in which case it would place strong constraints on the viability of SUSY as a theory.</p> <hr /> <p>Another way to search for supersymmetry at the LHC is to look for the production of “neutralinos” and “charginos,” which are the superpartners of the neutral and charged gauge bosons that mediate the weak nuclear force. These particles would be produced singly in high-energy collisions, and they would then decay into other particles, such as photons, leptons, and quarks. By looking for these decay products, physicists can search for evidence of neutralinos and charginos. One interesting feature of these particles is that they can be produced in pairs, and they can then annihilate into other particles, such as jets of quarks and leptons. By looking for these annihilation products, physicists can search for evidence of supersymmetry. Another Scenario could be the production of stau and gravitino as NLSP (Next Leading Super Particle) and LSP (Leading Super Particle ) respectively. This is an interesting scenario because the stau is a long lived particle and the gravitino is a very light particle. This should give us some unique but challengin signal. I’m currently working on investigating this scenario using LHCb long tracker as a potential detector for probing this scenario.</p> <p>Overall, the search for supersymmetry at the LHC is an important and ongoing effort in particle physics. It holds the potential to provide new insights into the fundamental nature of the universe and could potentially lead to the discovery of new particles and forces.</p> </div> </article> <aside id="comments" class="isso"> <div class="container"> <h3><i class="icon icon-comments-o"></i> Comments</h3> <div id="isso_thread"></div> <script data-isso="https://comments.melashri.eu.org/" data-isso-avatar="true" data-isso-vote="true" data-isso-vote-levels="-5,5" src="https://comments.melashri.eu.org/js/embed.min.js"></script> <section id="isso-thread"></section> <noscript> Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://blog.melashri.net" rel="nofollow">comments powered by ISSO.</a> </noscript> </div> </aside> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <small class="block">&copy; 2023 Mohamed Elashri &middot; &lt;/&gt; Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/VerifiedGruber/thinkspace">Thinkspace theme</a></small> </div> </footer> </main> </body> </html>
